**[Material Kit React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit-react/#/?ref=mkr-readme)** is a Free Material-UI Kit with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's material design and is was developed using [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). You asked for it, so we built it. It's a great pleasure to introduce to you the material concepts in an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Along with the restyling of the Material-UI elements, you will find three fully-coded example pages, to help you design your next project.
